# Manifold-Covers-of-Prism-Orbifolds (Thesis Project Code Repository)

This repository contains the code and computational workflows used in my thesis project. The project is organized into four folders corresponding to Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the thesis. Each folder contains:

- A Jupyter Notebook detailing the computations performed in that chapter.
- `.txt` files containing the results of the computations (except for chapter 3).

## Repository Structure
- **Chapter 3**: Contains the notebook and results related to computations in Chapter 3.
- **Chapter 4**: Contains the notebook and results related to computations in Chapter 4.
- **Chapter 5**: Contains the notebook and results related to computations in Chapter 5.
- **Chapter 6**: Contains the notebook and results related to computations in Chapter 6.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Read the Thesis Chapter**:  
   Each notebook is designed to align with its corresponding chapter in the thesis. It is highly recommended to read the relevant chapter before exploring the notebook. This will provide the necessary context and theoretical background for the computations (A link to the thesis will be provided).

2. **Explore the Notebook**:  
   Navigate to the folder of interest (e.g., `chapter-3`, `chapter-4`, `chapter-5`, or `chapter-6`) and open the Jupyter Notebook. The sections in the notebook follow the structure of the chapter.

3. **Refer to Result Files**:  
   Throughout the notebooks, references to `.txt` result files are provided. These files contain precomputed results from the computational steps. Open the referenced `.txt` files as needed while going through the notebook.
